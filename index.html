                <h2>What is PIN</h2>
                <p>
                    Pack Is Near (PIN) is a non-hierarchical, self-help group
                    for skaters that are grieving the loss of an important
                    aspect of their roller derby identity, be it through injury,
                    medical reasons, or any circumstances that keep them away
                    from the progress they have envisioned, the track and the
                    roller derby community. PIN welcomes all, no matter their
                    roller derby experience and skills, no matter how big the
                    issue they‚Äôre dealing with. We provide a safe space to tell
                    your story and express your emotions, to relate to other
                    people‚Äôs experiences, and to empower each other through
                    mutual help.

                <h2>Why we do this?</h2>
                <p>
                    We want to create a safe space where skaters can share their
                    experience with injury, trauma, grief, and coping
                    mechanisms. Every grieving skater has a unique story, but
                    our struggles are more common than we think. Sharing
                    personal thoughts and stories about our injuries helped us,
                    the group founders, feel less isolated, and being able to
                    provide support for others has made us feel empowered and in
                    control over our story. While waiting to get back on track,
                    this group is our small contribution to the roller derby
                    community, and especially for the members that become
                    invisible when they stay off the track for too long.

                    As moderators we will provide an online space that we
                    organize and manage, but all participants are equal during
                    the meeting. Group members can share experiences, tell their
                    story, get support and validation, but we do not give

                    The current format we propose are monthly online meetings in
                    small groups of maximum 6 people. A meeting lasts 1h30 with
                    15 minutes introduction, check in, and topics that we would
                    like to discuss, maximum 2 per meeting. The next hour will
                    be dedicated to sharing our stories and experiences on the
                    selected topic(s). The last 15 minutes are for a wrap up and
                    check out. During the meetings, all participants are
                    required to abide by the

                            I have been a nerdy couch potato my whole life,
                            until I discovered roller derby in late 2016. Within
                            a year I became an active, outgoing, sporty person,
                            and would seize any opportunity to improve my
                            skating skills and overall physical condition. My
                            (paid) career at the University has led me to live
                            in places that do not have roller derby, and for six
                            years I did my best to keep in shape, revise the
                            rules, travel 2h30 one way for a practice with the
                            closest team, join rosters of small leagues when
                            they were missing skaters for bouts, join scrimmages
                            as independent skater, apply as an official whenever
                            I could. I tried other sports, even broke my finger
                            trying out American football, but nothing compared
                            to the rush I got from roller derby. In 2024 I
                            finally moved to a city with a roller derby team,
                            joined their coaching squad, and started to get
                            ready for the Czech Roller Derby Team intakes. In
                            October 2024 I broke my ankle and shattered all my
                            plans about having a big breakthrough in my roller
                            derby journey. While the physical healing process
                            has been a consistent progress, the mental recovery
                            has been harder than what I have anticipated, and I
                            still have a long way to go before I feel
                            contact-ready.

                            My interests were always commented as ‚Äúunusual for a
                            girl‚Äù. I have never been a sports person even though
                            I quite enjoyed PE lessons at school. I was not
                            going to any sports club when I was a kid, nor was I
                            having any after school activities either. Therefore
                            it is still quite hard for me to develop habits. I
                            tried pole dancing before but I was really bad at
                            showing up at the practices. So I have been ‚Äúdoing‚Äù
                            the pole dance for many years but my progress was
                            not really something to talk about. I got to the
                            roller derby because of my long time friend but I
                            always thought that this sport is not for me. How
                            very mistaken I was! It changed after I saw the
                            first first bout that I hesitatedly admitted that
                            the palpable atmosphere of friendship is something I
                            would like as well. Firstly I was dealing with my
                            low attendance as before. But finding a place that
                            accepts that sometimes your life can be a mess, a
                            place where no one is commenting on your body, a
                            place where I could identify with various body types
                            which was completely opposite from my pole dance
                            experience. That was the thing that solved my
                            problem with attendance. I was going on the
                            trainings regularly, I even took up the gym sessions
                            twice a week. Since I know that concerning the body,
                            I am more of a slow learner, I started to officiate
                            to train my brain for roller derby as well. And all
                            this effort started to show. It really changed my
                            own perception of myself. Now I started to think
                            about myself as a sports person. And just at the
                            time when I started playing, I sprained my ankle. So
                            I took some time to heal. And I was preparing for
                            another game. And I have broken my leg in such a way
                            that it left me unable to take basic care for myself
                            for some time. It took out my autonomy. Yes, the
                            healing is progressing as it should. But I have
                            never even imagined the mental impact on one self
                            mind. And I started to realise that I cannot be in
                            this alone. That there are other people experiencing
                            something similar. So that's why I am here. I fell
                            in love with roller derby after I was dragged to
                            watch a bout by a very good friend. The palpable
                            atmosphere of friendship is what got me, but when I
                            joined the team I was struggling with attendance.
                            After all, I never had the chance to build healthy
                            sporting habits as a child. But finding a place that
                            accepts that life is sometimes messy, a place where
                            body positivity is the norm and where I could see
                            various body types, was a complete opposite of my
                            previous experience in sport, especially pole dance.
                            The supportive environment and positive image it
                            created for me solved my attendance issues - I
                            started training regularly, I even took up the gym
                            sessions twice a week. Very quickly I started
                            officiating, so I could train my brain for roller
                            derby as well. And all this effort started to show.
                            The perception of myself changed, for the better,
                            and I started thinking about myself as a sports
                            person. And just at the time when I started playing,
                            I sprained my ankle. So I took some time to heal. As
                            I was getting confident that I am bout-ready, I
                            sprained my ankle, which took weeks to recover, but
                            I was back and working on joining my first ever full
                            game. I made it to the game, but not for long - I
                            broke my leg in such a way that it left me unable to
                            take basic care for myself for some time. It took
                            out my autonomy. While the healing process is
                            progressing as it should, I was not ready for the
                            mental toll the injury would have on me. I started
                            to realise that I cannot be in this alone. That
                            there are other people experiencing something
                            similar. So that's why I am here.
